## My Books

These are the books that I own. I've read most of them, but there are a couple that I have not.

I've broken it up into sections that make sense to me as a developer. For each section, I've listed the number of books I have and clicking the link will take you to the full list.

I've also included the books I would highly recommend for each section on this page, but can find value in most of the books I have. Feel free to ask me about any of them.
